## Description
In this project, I have built machine learning models for detecting phishing URLs using Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression, integrated with Weights & Biases for comprehensive evaluation metrics and experiment tracking.

## Set Up Instructions

Follow the instructions to get the project:-

### Prerequisites
  * Python 3.8
  * Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, wandb

### Installation

1. Clone or download these repositories and open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.

2. Install Dependencies

  * pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn wandb

3. Download the dataset

4. Open the respective notebooks to try out the built models above in a Google colab.

## Technologies Used

  * Python 3.8: Programming language
  * Pandas: Data manipulation
  * Numpy: Numerical computations
  * Scikit-learn: Machine learning
  * Weights & Biases: Experiment tracking
  * Google Colab: Cloud-based execution

## Models

 * Logistic Regression
 * Decision Tree

In this project, the Decision Tree Classifier excelled at capturing complex, non-linear patterns in the data, resulting in a higher accuracy of 94%. In contrast, the Logistic Regression model, which assumes a linear relationship, achieved a lower accuracy of 83%. This difference highlights the Decision Tree's superior performance in handling the intricacies of the dataset.
